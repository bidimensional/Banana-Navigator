# Banana-Navigator

### Introduction

This is my implementation to solve the Banana Navigation project on the Udacity Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree.

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes. I actually stopped when I reached an Average Score of 20.

This has been implemented using a Dueling Network Architecture with Epsilon-Greedy policy and an Experience Replay.

### Repository Contents

- **Navigation.ipynb** - this is the all-in-one notebook to train and solve the project
- **model.pt** - final saved weights after training. I considered the problem solved once the Average Score reached 20.


### Instructions

Follow the instructions in `Navigation.ipynb` to train and visualize the score improvements over time.
